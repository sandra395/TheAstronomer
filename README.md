# TheAstronomer

using p5.js

I decided to attempt creating one of the works of one 
of the best painters from the Dutch school. 

In this case, I chose to recreate the painting "The Astronomer" 
by Johannes Vermeer. I believe this work shows the essence 
of Baroque, and you can appreciate the clothing worn during 
that time, along with the type of houses they lived and worked in.
First, I made a sketch on paper using simple shapes. 

Then, I started by creating the globe (using ellipse and rectangle) 
because it served as a reference for the other elements. 
Next, I created the window (using rectangle and lines). 
At first, I used simple shapes (rectangle, ellipse, arc, lines), 
but I realized they wouldn't work for some forms. 
These shapes were created using a series of vertices. 
Once I was happy with the result, I chose the colours 
and painted the different parts of the drawing.  
Since it didn't look quite right, and some elements were 
not distinguishable, I decided to use outlines and transparencies
for some elements' fills. 

To help me with the code, I used the documentation 
shared in the classroom and some YouTube tutorials:
